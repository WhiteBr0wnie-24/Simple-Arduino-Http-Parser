# Simple-Arduino-Http-Parser
A pretty basic HTTP request parser/generator for Arduino boards. It only uses standard String functions and does not support any fancy features. It's also very unsafe and must not be used in any application that requires any form of security. The "library"'s main purpose is to simplify IoT prototyping.
